![Karumi logo][karumilogo] KataScreenshot in Kotlin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataScreenshotKotlin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataScreenshotKotlin)
============================

- We are here to practice UI testing using [screenshot tests for Android][screenshotFramework].
- We are going to use [Espresso][espresso] to interact with the Application UI.
- We are going to use [Kodein][kodein] to replace production code with [Test Doubles][testDoubles].
- We are going to practice pair programming.

**You can compare this testing approach with [a different testing strategy][kataSuperHeroesAndroid] where the application UI is tested using just Espresso.**

---

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show Super Heroes information:

![ApplicationScreencast][applicationScreencast]

This Application is based on two Activities:

* ``MainActivity`` showing a list of super heroes with name, photo and a special badge if it is part of the Avengers Team.

![MainActivityScreenhot][mainActivityScreenshot]

* ``SuperHeroDetailActivity`` showing detailed information about a super hero like his or her name, photo and description.

![SuperHeroDetailActivityScreenshot][superHeroDetailActivityScreenshot]


The application architecture, dependencies and configuration is ready to just start writing tests. In this project you'll find  ``Kodein`` configured to be able to replace production code with test doubles easily and Espresso to be able to interact with the application user interface and a screenshot testing framework ready to compare your application changes.

Remember that after any production code change you can record your screenshots again executing:

```
./gradlew executeScreenshotTests -Precord
```

To verify the correct behaviour of your code you can execute:

```
./gradlew executeScreenshotTests
```

To be able to get a deterministic test scenario all our tests will be executed on the same emulated device. You can use the Travis-CI configuration to get the same emulator working on your computer.


## Tasks

Your task as Android Developer is to **write all the UI tests** needed to check if the Application UI is working as expected. 

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**


Our recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository.
    2. Checkout `kata-screenshot` branch.
    3. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.
    4. Execute `MainActivityTest` and watch the only test it contains pass.

  * To help you get started, these are some test cases for `MainActivity`:     
    1. Setup mocked `SuperHeroRepository` in `MainActivityTest` to return a list of some Super Heroes.
    2. Test the ``MainActivity`` is showing the super heroes obtained from the ``SuperHeroesRepository``.
    3. Test the empty case is shown if there are no super heroes.

## Considerations

* If you get stuck, `master` branch contains already solved tests for `MainActivity`, `SuperHeroDetailActivity` and `SuperHeroViewHolder`.
  
## Extra Tasks

If you've covered all the application functionality using UI tests try to continue with the following tasks:

* Add a pull to refresh mechanism to ``MainActivity`` and test it.
* Modify ``SuperHeroDetailActivity`` to handle an error case where the name of the super hero used to start this activity does not exist and show a message if this happens.
* Modify the project to handle connection errors and show a ``SnackBar`` to indicate something went wrong.
* Modify ``SuperHeroesRepository`` test double to perform a ``Thread.sleep`` and use the custom idling resources you'll find in this repository to get your tests working.
* Compare your tests implementation with the [KataSuperHeroes](kataSuperHeroesAndroid) solved using Espresso.
